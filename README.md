## Creators
By **group 1142**
- Dario Patzi Chavez
- Marja Emilia Steuer
- Mathilde Bianco
- Robert Josua Michels

## Files
This repository includes all the documents as part of the group project.
It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook including the code and explanation (Code&Doc.ipynb)
- A python file with the raw code (Code1142.py)
- A pdf file with the documentation explaining the code line per line (Documentation1142.pdf)

## Getting Started
The entire code/ program can be executed using the following function which encompasses all other functions.
It will enable the user to select a character, choose a desired attribute, and test the odds in competing within a tournament. 
  ```python
  tournament_duel()
  ```

### Prerequisits
The code is written in Python 3.9.7
To run this program, and simulate a tournament between fictional characters including a choice of attributes, both `numpy` and `random` are required.

- numpy
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  ```
- random
  ```python
  import random
  ```
